    "text": "From my first job tutoring at a Kumon Learning Center, to managing after school and summer programs at the International Rescue Committee, to teaching graduate-level courses at the University of Pennsylvania, I find deep fulfillment in supporting young people on their academic journeys. I particularly enjoy teaching statistics to audiences that are intimidated by the subject (as I once was). I owe so much of my understanding of effective teaching to my mother, who dedicated her career to teaching elementary school.\nIn addition to these teaching responsibilities, I have met regularly with master’s students in my department to discuss course selection, career options, and PhD applications."

    "text": "Instructor\n\nEDUC 6667: Introductory Statistics for Educational Research (2023, 2024)\n\n“Incredibly supportive and modeled vulnerability, kindness, openness, patience. Opened the course with a social justice point of view. Available to help outside of class and so generous with her time. Structured the lectures logically and each one built on the last. I liked that lectures were interspersed with group work.”\n“The instructor made an intimidating subject matter for our class approachable and interesting. She offered a warm and welcoming space for questions and concerns. She checked in every class with how each student was feeling, and offered a great amount of flexible availability to meet outside of class for help. The instructor approached the content in the best manner she could considering the shortened course length.”\n\n\n\nEDUC 6680: Evaluation of Policies, Programs, and Projects (2024)\n\n“This course has been exceptionally well-organized. From start to finish, I always knew exactly what I was doing and where I stood in terms of progress. Lindsay consistently kept us informed about the course trajectory, ensuring we were aware of where we were in the syllabus at all times. Her lectures were incredibly well-structured and resourceful, covering all the essential topics in program evaluation. Despite the breadth of the material, I never felt overwhelmed. Lindsay is very considerate, always taking the time to understand her students’ perspectives and offering support when needed. In each lecture, Lindsay consistently provided practical examples relevant to the topic and introduced key figures and articles related to the subject matter. Her lecture slides are comprehensive and serve as a valuable resource that I will continue to reference for learning long after the course has ended.”\n“I am truly grateful to Lindsay for being so accessible and creating an open space where we could always approach her with our challenges. She has consistently been incredibly supportive, helping to make our learning journey smoother and more manageable. In the context of our program, this course is invaluable, and I highly recommend that it continue to be offered in the same way Lindsay has designed it.”"
